a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an instance of a class is created and can be used to set initial values for object attributes. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.
Two ways to use modules:
Import converters
print(converters.kgl_to_lbs(50)
OR
From converters import kgl_to_lbs
kgl_to_lbs(50)
